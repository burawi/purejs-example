# You don't need a framework
This is what I've been saying to developer-friends for the last months.

Here is a working example that uses nothing but new JS features.

## Usage

1- clone the repo
2- move to the repo:
```
cd purejs-example
```
3- Install Pkgs:
```
npm i
```
4- start the app:
```
npm start
```

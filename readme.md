Here is a working example that uses nothing but new JS features.

## Usage

1- Clone the repo

2- Move to the repo folder:
```
cd purejs-example
```
3- Install node modules (nothing but live-server):
```
npm i
```
4- Start the app:
```
npm start
```

PS: If you're using VSCode, you can install **ES6 String HTML** extension (`hjb2012.vscode-es6-string-html`), in order to highlight html in js strings.
